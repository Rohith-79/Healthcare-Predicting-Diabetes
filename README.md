# Healthcare-Predicting-Diabetes

This project involves analyzing the Healthcare Diabetes dataset from NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) to uncover insights into various health metrics that may influence diabetes prevalence. The visualizations were created using Tableau to facilitate better understanding and interpretation of the data.

## Dashboard Overview

The Tableau dashboard provides multiple visualizations to explore and analyze the dataset effectively. Below is a summary of the components included in the dashboard:

### 1. Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic Pie Chart
- This pie chart shows the distribution of individuals who are diabetic versus those who are non-diabetic.
- **Key Insight**: The dataset contains 500 diabetic individuals and 268 non-diabetic individuals.

### 2. Insulin vs. Glucose Scatter Plot
- A scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between insulin levels and glucose levels.
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Red circles indicate diabetic individuals.
  - Green circles indicate non-diabetic individuals.
- **Key Insight**: This plot helps in identifying patterns of insulin and glucose levels between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

### 3. BMI vs. Skin Thickness, Insulin vs. Glucose, and Other Scatter Plots
- Scatter plots displaying the relationships between different pairs of health metrics, such as:
  - BMI vs. Skin Thickness
  - Insulin vs. Glucose
  - Various other combinations
- **Key Insight**: Allows comparison of different factors to understand their correlation with diabetes.

### 4. Histograms
- Histograms for various features, including:
  - **BMI**
  - **Blood Pressure**
  - **Insulin**
  - **Age**
  - **Diabetes Pedigree Function**
  - **Glucose**
  - **Pregnancies**
  - **Skin Thickness**
- **Key Insight**: These histograms provide an understanding of the distribution of each feature across the dataset.

### 5. Bubble Chart by Age Group for Outcome
- A bubble chart representing different age groups and their associated diabetes outcome ratios.
- **Bubble Size and Color**: The size and color intensity of each bubble reflect the outcome ratio.
- **Key Insight**: Helps to identify which age groups have a higher proportion of diabetic individuals.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis is derived from the NIDDK Diabetes Dataset. The dataset includes various health metrics that can be indicators for diagnosing diabetes, such as:

- **Age**
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Insulin Levels**
- **Glucose Levels**
- **Skin Thickness**
- **Number of Pregnancies**
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**

## Objectives

The primary objective of this analysis is to identify significant patterns and relationships between various health indicators and diabetes. By understanding these relationships, healthcare professionals can make informed decisions about diabetes risk factors and management strategies.

## Key Findings

1. **High Glucose Levels Correlate with Diabetes**: Individuals with higher glucose levels are more likely to be diabetic.
2. **Age Group Patterns**: The 50-54 age group shows a higher ratio of diabetes prevalence compared to other age groups.
3. **Impact of Insulin Levels**: The scatter plots suggest a varying distribution of insulin levels between diabetic and non-diabetic groups.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. **Open the Tableau Dashboard**: You can navigate through the different visualizations to explore the dataset.
2. **Interactive Filters**: Use interactive elements to filter data and gain deeper insights into specific metrics.
3. **Tooltips**: Hover over data points for more detailed information.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a visual approach to understanding diabetes prevalence based on health metrics. It helps identify key factors that might contribute to diabetes risk, which could be useful for further research or healthcare planning.
