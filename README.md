# Healthcare-Predicting-Diabetes

This project involves analyzing the Diabetes dataset to understand various health metrics and their impact on diabetes prevalence. Using Tableau, a comprehensive dashboard was created to visualize and analyze the data, focusing on key health indicators that help in identifying patterns associated with diabetes.

## Dashboard Overview

The Tableau dashboard offers a range of visualizations to explore and analyze the dataset. Below is an explanation of each component included:

### 1. Diabetic vs. Non-Diabetic Pie Chart
- The pie chart displays the distribution of individuals who are diabetic and non-diabetic.
- **Key Insight**: The dataset consists of 268 diabetic individuals and 500 non-diabetic individuals.

### 2. Heatmap of Health Metrics by Age Groups
- A heatmap shows the average values of key health metrics across different age groups, including:
  - **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
  - **Blood Pressure**
  - **Glucose**
  - **Insulin**
  - **Skin Thickness**
- **Key Insight**: Allows comparison of health metrics across age groups, revealing trends in how these values vary with age.

### 3. Scatter Plot of BMI vs. Other Variables
- Scatter plots visualizing the relationships between **BMI** and other important health metrics such as glucose and insulin.
- **Key Insight**: Useful for identifying correlations between BMI and other factors, highlighting trends in diabetic and non-diabetic groups.

### 4. Histogram of BMI
- A histogram showing the distribution of BMI values across the dataset.
- **Key Insight**: Helps in understanding how BMI is distributed, and where most individuals fall within the BMI range.

### 5. Bubble Chart by Age Bins
- A bubble chart depicting age groups (bins) and their representation in the dataset.
- **Bubble Size and Color**: The size and color intensity indicate the proportion of diabetic individuals within each age bin.
- **Key Insight**: Identifies which age groups have a higher occurrence of diabetes.

## Data Source

The data used in this analysis is derived from a Diabetes Prediction dataset, which includes key health indicators such as:

- **Age**
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
- **Blood Pressure**
- **Insulin Levels**
- **Glucose Levels**
- **Skin Thickness**

## Objectives

The main objective of this project is to explore significant patterns and relationships between various health indicators and the likelihood of diabetes. This helps in understanding risk factors and supporting healthcare professionals in diagnosing and managing diabetes more effectively.

## Key Findings

1. **Higher Glucose and Insulin Levels Are Linked to Diabetes**: Individuals with elevated glucose and insulin levels tend to show a higher likelihood of being diabetic.
2. **Age Group Trends**: The 50-55 age group shows relatively higher average glucose levels, indicating a stronger correlation with diabetes.
3. **BMI Distribution**: A significant portion of the dataset consists of individuals with a BMI in the range of 25-35, highlighting the need to understand obesity's impact on diabetes risk.

## How to Use the Dashboard

1. **Open the Tableau Dashboard**: Navigate through the various visualizations to explore different metrics.
2. **Interact with the Filters**: Utilize interactive elements to filter data by age groups, glucose levels, and more to gain deeper insights.
3. **Hover for Details**: Use tooltips by hovering over data points for more specific information.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into how different health metrics are associated with diabetes. It supports healthcare initiatives by offering a visual approach to understanding diabetes risk factors, which can be crucial for early detection and preventive measures.
